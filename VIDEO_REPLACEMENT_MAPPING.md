## Implementation Notes

1. **Database Updates**: You'll need to update the `track_modules` table to replace `video_id` fields with `external_url` fields for these videos.

2. **Content Verification**: Before implementing, verify that all YouTube URLs are still active and appropriate for the content.

3. **LGBT+ Content**: Special attention should be paid to LGBT+ specific content to ensure it's culturally competent and appropriate.

4. **External URLs**: Some links point to external websites rather than YouTube - these should be handled appropriately in the frontend.

5. **Playlists**: Some URLs point to YouTube playlists - consider how these should be displayed in the UI.

## Next Steps

1. Create SQL migration scripts to update the database
2. Test video loading in the frontend
3. Verify all URLs are accessible
4. Update any broken or inappropriate links
5. Consider adding video duration and thumbnail information
