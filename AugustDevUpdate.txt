Frehab: Project Summary & Status
As of: Thursday, August 7, 2025
Current Domain: Frehab.org

1. Project Vision & Guiding Philosophy
Mission: To create a free, anonymous, and inclusive online platform that provides an evidence-based, community-powered path to recovery from any addiction.

Core Philosophies:

"Odin Project" Model: We provide a structured, linear curriculum that guides users through a comprehensive program, rather than just offering a collection of tools.

"Core + Multi-Specialization" Architecture: The curriculum consists of a universal Core program (the "operating system" of recovery) enhanced with specialized content blocks tailored to the multiple, specific addictions a user selects (e.g., Alcohol, Gambling, Stimulants).

Inclusivity & Harm Reduction: We explicitly support all recovery paths, including abstinence, moderation, and harm reduction. This is embodied by our flexible "Personal Goal Tracker."

Dual-Track Curriculum: Our program focuses on two parallel goals:

The Foundation (How to Stop): Building the skills to manage cravings and triggers.

The Framework (How to Live): Proactively building a meaningful life that makes sobriety a positive choice.

Humor & Relatability: We will tastefully incorporate humor and personality to make the platform feel human and supportive, not clinical.

2. Project Outline & Technical Architecture
Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS ("Calm Harmony" theme)

Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth)

Deployment: Vercel

Open Source License: AGPL 3.0 (Chosen to ensure Frehab and all its derivatives remain open-source).

Key Platform Components:

User Authentication: A complete system for email/password and social OAuth logins.

User Dashboard: A personalized hub for returning users.

Personal Goal Tracker: A configurable dashboard widget for tracking abstinence, moderation, or custom daily goals.

Core Program: An 8-module curriculum with dynamic, personalized content.

Private Journal: A secure space for users to complete Action-Based Projects.

Community Hub: A planned forum for peer-to-peer support (to be integrated with Discourse).

Frehab Wiki: A planned community-built knowledge base.

Achievement System: A planned gamification system to reward user progress.

3. Current Status & Progress So Far
We have successfully built the foundational "vertical slice" of the application.

✅ Initial Scaffolding: The complete Next.js project structure is built and configured.

✅ Branding: The domain frehab.org has been secured and the project has been renamed accordingly.

✅ User Authentication: A user can successfully sign up, log in (via email or social providers), and log out. The application correctly maintains session state.

✅ Dashboard UI: The main dashboard layout is built, including a sidebar and widgets.

✅ Personal Goal Tracker: The initial "Sobriety Tracker" has been successfully refactored into the more inclusive "Personal Goal Tracker," allowing users to choose their own goal.

✅ Core Program Framework: The database schema and UI pages for the program are built. This includes a landing page that lists all modules and a dynamic page template that can render content for any given module.

✅ Module 1 & 2 Content: The "Lessons & Tools" sections for Module 1 are fully implemented with dynamic content. The same implementation is in progress for Module 2.

✅ Private Journal (Partial): The backend and UI for the Module 1 Action-Based Project have been implemented, allowing users to save their work to the database.

✅ Design for Key Features: We have completed detailed design documents for the Achievement System and the Expandable Callout component (including animation and haptics).

4. Immediate & Future Implementation Plan
This is our roadmap moving forward.

Immediate Next Steps:

Implement Expandable Callout Component: Build the reusable component with animation and sensory feedback that will be used to display the multi-specialization content within modules.

Complete Module 2:

Build the UI for the "Trigger & Craving Map" Action-Based Project.

Implement the backend logic to save this project to the user's journal.

Implement Achievement System (Backend):

Build the database tables (achievements, user_achievements).

Create the server-side logic to grant achievements when users complete projects (starting with the Module 1 & 2 projects).

Future Roadmap (The Path to MVP Launch):

Build Out Modules 3-8: Sequentially complete each module's lessons, tools, and Action-Based Project.

Build Full Journal UI: Create the main journal page that allows users to browse, read, and edit all their past entries.

Build Achievement UI: Create the "Achievements" page to display earned and unearned trophies.

Integrate Community Hub: Set up and link to our managed Discourse forum.

Build Out Wiki: Create the initial framework and seed it with the articles identified in the curriculum plan.

Incorporate Humor: Implement the "Sarcastic" daily affirmation setting and add personality to microcopy.

Finalize Legal: Add the LICENSE file and copyright/trademark notices to the site.
